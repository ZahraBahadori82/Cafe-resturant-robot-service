# Cafe-resturant-robot-service
A complete cafe restaurant ordering and delivery system. Customers scan a QR code to order via Flutter Web, and orders are stored in an SQL database. Real-time updates are pushed to kitchen, cashier, and admin dashboards using Socket.IO. Robot communication is handled through MQTT for automated delivery and status tracking.
